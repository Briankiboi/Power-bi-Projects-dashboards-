## 🚀 Power BI Projects & Dashboards  

🔹 **Project Name:** `Power-bi-Projects-dashboards`  
📊 This project showcases my expertise in **Power BI** as a data analysis tool. It includes various **dashboards and reports** that demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights.  

🔍 **Key Highlights:**  
✔️ Data Cleaning & Transformation  
✔️ Interactive Dashboards  
✔️ Data Visualization Best Practices  
✔️ Business Intelligence Insights  

💡 **Note:** Since the dashboards are a bit large, click on **"View Raw"** to download the `.pbix` file and open it in **Power BI Desktop** for a full experience.  

Each `.pbix` file is a standalone Power BI report project. You can open and explore them individually in Power BI Desktop.
